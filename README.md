# Getting started with the Elastic Stack

 Looking for an Elastic Stack ("ELK" tutorial) that shows how to set up the Elastic Stack? In this tutorial, you learn how to get up and running quickly. First you install the core open source products:
 
*Elasticsearch
*Kibana
*Beats
*Logstach
Then you learn how to implement a system monitoring solution that uses Metricbeat to collect server metrics and ship the data to Elasticsearch, where you can search and visualize the data by using Kibana. After you get the basic setup working, you add Logstash for additional parsing.

To get started, you can install the Elastic Stack on a single VM or even on your laptop.

Implementing security is a critical step in setting up the Elastic Stack. To get up and running quickly with a sample installation, you skip those steps right now. Before sending sensitive data across the network, make sure you secure the Elastic Stack and enable encrypted communications.
